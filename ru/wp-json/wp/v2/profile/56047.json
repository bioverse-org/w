Only ~0.1 percent of 5+ billion articles on the English Wikipedia achieved this designation, signified by a star icon to the right of the title. They&#8217;re considered the best articles Wikipedia has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Volunteer editors often spend hours researching, sourcing, and writing these articles. Take the article on <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vasa_(ship)\"><i>Vasa<\/i><\/a>, for example. It goes to show that any Wikipedia article can be a featured article\u2014even one about a centuries-old Swedish shipwreck. But it wouldn&#8217;t have happened without the efforts of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Peter_Isotalo\">Peter Isotalo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Isotalo helped rewrite the English Wikipedia article on the 1628 shipwreck. According to <i>Vasa&#8217;s<\/i> Wikipedia article, the ship \u201chas become a widely recognized symbol of the Swedish \u2018great power period&#8217; and is \u2026 a de facto standard in the media and among Swedes for evaluating the historical importance of shipwrecks.\u201d Today, <i>Vasa<\/i> is a museum ship in Stockholm.<\/p>\n<p>Isotalo worked with fellow editor <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Henrik\">Henrik<\/a> to re-write the English version of the <i>Vasa<\/i> article. He describes the ship as a time capsule, one that \u201coffers an insight into a completely different, lost world. It has a physical presence that makes it easy to comprehend and size up even for non-nerds like myself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Getting insider access to the <\/b><b><i>Vasa<\/i><\/b><b> shipwreck<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Isotalo is a trained records manager and archivist with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in history. Isotalo describes himself as a civil servant\/bureaucrat of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bureaucracy#Max_Weber\">Weberian<\/a> variety, and works for the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, a foreign aid non-governmental organization (NGO).<\/p>\n<p>Born in 1980 in the-then Soviet Union, Isotalo moved to Sweden as a child. His interest in maritime history was kindled during this time, as he was able to visit the Vasa Museum and later work in the Vasa Museum&#8217;s gift shop.<\/p>\n<p>The latter experience came in handy when writing the <i>Vasa<\/i> Wikipedia article. He had easy access to the museum&#8217;s staff\u2014including its Director of Research Fred Hocker, who Isotalo called \u201cone of the leading experts on<i>Vasa<\/i>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These individuals were able assist him in learning about history of the ship and its recovery, what was happening in Sweden and its navy around that time, and <i>Vasa&#8217;s<\/i> preservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p><b>Hundreds of hours researching shipwrecks<\/b><\/p>\n<p>After <i>Vasa<\/i>, Isotalo continued onto another lost warship raised hundreds of years after being sunk\u2014England&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mary_Rose\"><i>Mary Rose.<\/i><\/a> It&#8217;s also a featured article.<\/p>\n<p>Isotalo estimates that he has spent hundreds of hours on the two articles. \u201cWhen I get hooked on a particular topic and really go for it,\u201d he says, \u201cI tend to pursue pretty much every lead I can get a hold of.\u201d This sort of obstinacy has helped in ensuring that the articles are complete; he points to the \u201cCauses of sinking\/Modern theories\u201d section in Mary Rose to make this point.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI spent quite a lot of time tracking down different perspectives and made sure to check up even on fairly obscure references,\u201d he said, including \u201ca rather minor (but important) critical note about potential eyewitness bias from Maurice de Brossard in a 1984 issue of <i>Mariner&#8217;s Mirror<\/i>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Presenting all sides for a neutral point of view<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Extensive research, however, posed its own set of problems. \u201cThe history of [<i>Vasa<\/i> and <i>Mary Rose<\/i>] is often subsumed under layers of dramatic storytelling,\u201d Isotalo says. \u201cThere is a tendency to fit into a rather nationalist historical narrative\u2014especially with <i>Vasa<\/i>, where the history of the ship itself has been presented through the perspective of being the personal property of an absolute monarch, which is clearly not true.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He continues:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The modern discovery of <i>Vasa<\/i> in the 1950s is often portrayed as the work of a single man (Anders Franz\u00e9n), and previous knowledge of the ship&#8217;s location has been largely ignored or glossed over. The decision to salvage the ship is also portrayed as something more or less self-evident, though it really wasn&#8217;t. Today, most maritime archaeologists would consider it an unnecessary (and extremely costly) risk to salvage entire shipwrecks.
